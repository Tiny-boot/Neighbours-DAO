## I. Introduction

This DAO, called Neighbours-DAO, has been designed with the goal of increasing the involvement of people in their communities. The idea first came from the realisation that in big cities and smaller ones, only a fraction of the inhabitants are really involved in the decision process of urban design and rullings. Our objective is to create a platform that would incite more people to vote because they would be rewarded, but also to have a more transparent process on how the funds were spent by governing instances. The Neighbours-DAO is a on-chain governance system that enables decentralised decision-making. For this purpose we are using an extended version of an ERC20 both for voting token and reward.

## III. Reflection 

What was the motivation in the chosen token and governance model? Eg. Better engagement? simple voting?
Did you encounter any technical difficulties like merge conflicts?
Did you encounter any interpersonal difficulties while managing the two development streams?
